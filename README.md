- 👋 Hi, I’m Jay!
- 👀 Here you can find all the ✨ horrible code ✨ I've written over the years!
- ✍ At the moment I'm mainly working in C#, but in the past I've used C, C++, Python, Rust, Lua, and other languages.
- 📬 I can be reached via email at jay0@me.com, or on Discord as `dreadfullydistinct#1458`

I'm also looking for contributors to [DragaliaAPI](https://github.com/SapiensAnatis/DragaliaAPI) -- if you are familiar with C# and the ASP.NET stack in particular and would like to help, let me know!
